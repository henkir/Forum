Forum Project created by Jonas Hesselryd (jonhe442) and Henrik Holmberg (henho106).

You must _TURN OFF_ Google AppEngine in order to get the database connection to work.

To create the database on a MySQL server where you have privileges to create a new database, simply use "source path/to/database.sql". The file is located in Forum/other.
This creates the database and populates it with example data. Three users are created, admin, moder and test (passwords is the same as usernames).
A user in MySQL is created, forum_user which logs in with forum_pass.
